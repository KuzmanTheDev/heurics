1. Set up react
2. Create routes to Instructions, about and home
3. implement redux
define components

Brainstorm -----------------
The scripts

Script (arrows/directions) as component:
 switch(location):
  case toolbox:
    normal view

  case picked (trnsition)
    view - box with solid black border

  case workbench (scriptEditor)
    view - rectangular bar


Script (func & repeat) as component:
 switch(location):
  case toolbox:
   same
  case picked:
   rectangular bar with a bottom hook
  case workbench:
    some logic required. length of hook has to match the quantity of arrows
   



you might have to remove volume and if (?)

4. list actions
5. develop reducers
6. build store
7. connect to app
